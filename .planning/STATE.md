# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-10-22)

**Core value:** Audit-grade, high-precision reconciliation and statutory tax computation that eliminates double-counting, strictly guarantees zero merged cells in analytical workbooks, and runs completely locally and securely.
**Current focus:** Milestone Complete — All 3 Phases Executed and Verified

## Current Position

Phase: 3 — Automated Scrutiny Tests & Audit Trail Hardening
Plan: Complete (03-01 and 03-02 verified)
Status: Completed
Last activity: 2026-10-22 — Phase 03 verified (Verdict: PASSED, 68/68 tests passing)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 03]: Comprehensive scrutiny test suite in `src/test/debitNoteScrutiny.test.ts` (21 tests) rigorously validates subset-sum combinatorics ($2 \le |S| \le 15$ with 8-12 decoys), tolerance boundary cents, multi-prefix normalization, and 50+ batch zero double-counting accounting invariants ($\sum \text{Reconciled} = \sum \text{Raw}$).
- [Phase 03]: Immutable SQLite audit trail table `reconciliation_audit_log` with indexes on timestamp, gstin, and company, mounted via Express REST routes in `server.js` (`POST`, `GET`, `GET /export`).
- [Phase 03]: Offline durability with dual storage engine in `auditTrailService.ts` (`localStorage` in browser, in-memory queue in test/Node environments) and auto-sync on `window.online`.
- [Phase 03]: `AuditJustificationModal.tsx` prompts for practitioner justification ($\ge 5$ characters) on force match, manual match, and unlink actions across both `PartyWiseReport.tsx` and `ResultsTable.tsx`.
- [Phase 03]: Zero-Merge 12-column `'Audit Trail'` sheet added to `masterExport.ts`, `partyWiseExport.ts`, and `excelExport.worker.ts` preserving the strict `ws['!merges'] = []` invariant (`CORE-01`).
- [Phase 02]: Monolithic `fileParser.ts` decomposed into `src/lib/excel/` (`styles/`, `parsers/`, `builders/`) with 100% backward-compatible 9-line barrel.
- [Phase 02]: Strict Zero-Merge Architecture (`ws['!merges'] = []`) enforced systematically across all sheet builders and export worker.
- [Phase 02]: Dedicated Web Worker `excelExport.worker.ts` with SheetJS Dense Mode (`dense: true`) and chunked row generation proves <180MB peak heap delta on 50,000 rows (measured ~59.6 MB).
- [Phase 02]: Asynchronous service `exportWorkbookAsync` connects to UI buttons with dynamic toast progress and graceful headless fallback.

### Pending Todos

None.
